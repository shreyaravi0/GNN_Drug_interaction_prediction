# 🧬 Drug Interaction Prediction Project

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on predicting drug–drug interactions (DDIs) using a **Graph Neural Network (GNN)**. Drugs are represented using **SMILES** (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System), enabling the model to capture detailed molecular structure information. These molecular representations are converted into graphs, which are then processed by a GNN to learn interaction patterns between pairs of drugs.

The system integrates:
- **Machine Learning**
- **Graph-based molecular representations**
- **Deep Learning**

to predict whether two drugs are likely to interact.

## ⚙️ Workflow

### 1. Data Preparation
- Drug pairs are read from the DrugBank dataset.
- SMILES strings are converted into molecular graphs.

### 2. Model Training
- A **Graph Neural Network** is trained using molecular graph representations.
- The trained model learns interaction patterns between drugs.

### 3. Prediction
- Users input two drug SMILES strings.
- The model predicts:
  - **Interaction label** (Interacting / Non-Interacting)
  - **Interaction probability**

### 4. Visualization
- 2D molecular structures are displayed.
- IUPAC names are retrieved and shown in the frontend.
